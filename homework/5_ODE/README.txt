TASK A.3:
The rkstep12- and driver-function is checked if working with the ODE u''=-u.
The data is in out.sin.data and it is plotted in sin.plot.png.

TASK A.4:
The data was first produced for T_c=3 days and saved in out.SIR1.data and S, I and R is plotted in SIR.plot.png for this value of T_c. Furthermore, data was produced for T_c=1 day and T_c=0,5 day and saved in out.SIR2.data and out.SIR3.data respectively. The amount of infectious as a function of time is plotted for the three different values of T_c in SIR.comparison.plot.png. It is seen that the lower value of T_c the faster the virus spreads, but it also dies out faster. In general, more people get infected the lower the value of T_c.

TASK C:
The data is saved in out.3body.data and plotted in 3body.plot.png.
