Task A:

The root(s) of the set of equation 5*z-2x=0, 2*y-14+x=0 and 4*z-10*y=0 is:
x(root) =
   10.6061 
   1.69697 
   4.24242 
Which, when checked, actually is the root. So it seems like the implementation works

The extremum(s) of the RosenBrock's valley function is found by differentiating the function and using our Newton's method implementation to find the roots:
x(min) =
   1.00002 
   1.00004 
Which matches the expected root (1,1)

Task B:

The lowest root, e_0, for r_max=8 is:
e_0 =
 -0.499975 
The exact value is -0.5.

Task C:

As it is seen in convergence_comparison.png, the second boundary condition leads to a much faster convergence towards the exact result than the first boundary condition.
